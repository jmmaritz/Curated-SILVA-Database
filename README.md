# Curated-SILVA-Database
A curated, protist-focused database for 18S rRNA gene taxonomic assignments.

## DESCRIPTION:

This is a curated, protist focused reference database based on the QIIME compatible files of the SILVA version 111 database.

The Eukaryotic sequences from the SILVA 111 database were curated to remove sequences annotated as: 'uncultured', 'unidentified', and 'clone'.
The remainiing eukaryotic sequences, with a focus on protist taxa, were further curated to reflect taxonomy. 
Several sequences from protists of interest not present in the original database were added.

The Euk_only_curated directory contains the fasta files for this database, taxa maps and template alignments.

The original files from the SILVA 111 database are also included in the database.

See the [SILVA_111_curation_notes.txt](./SILVA_111_curation_notes.txt) file for further information.
