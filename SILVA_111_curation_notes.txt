Notes on the curation of the QIIME compatible version of SILVA 111

The QIIME compatible files of SILVA 111 were downloaded from the QIIMe website(ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/QIIME_nonstandard_referencedb/Silva_111.tgz).

The Eukaryotic sequences from the Silva_111_taxa_map_no_ambiguous.txt and Silva_111_full_unaligned_no_ambig.fasta files were used as the base of this effort.
They were curated to remove sequences annotated as: 'uncultured', 'unidentified', and 'clone'. 
The remainiing eukaryotic sequences, with a focus on protist taxa, were further curated to reflect taxonomy. This included removing and or reannotating
misannotated sequences and adding taxonomic placeholders to help preserve accutate taxonomic levels across groups.
Additionally, several sequences from protists of interest not present in the original database were added.
This resulted in a final representative set of 46,094 Eukaryotes.

The Euk_only_curated directory contains the fasta files for this database, taxa maps and template alignments.
 
Template alignments were generated for these files by aligning the curated Eukaryote sequences to the Eukaryote template alignment provided in the Silva 111 release
(99_Silva_111_rep_set_euk_aligned.fasta), using PyNAST in QIIME with a threshold of 60% identity. Fasta files and taxa maps with the alignment failures removed are also included (NOpynast_fails.fasta).

A version of this template alignment without taxonomy strings, for use in Qiime 1.9, was created using the truncate_fasta_labels.py (https://gist.github.com/walterst/5b1db2a11a4490c57169). 

The folder '99_clusters' contains the contains the SILVA sequences clustered at 99 percent identity from the original download.
These files were used to re-blast any unidentified OTUs after the curated database was used to assign taxonomy. This method was employed to prevent Bacterial, Archael,
and other known sequences from artificially inflating the number of unassigned sequences. 

These curated files were prepared by Julia Maritz (jmm1005 at nyu dot edu)

See SILVA_111_QIIME_format_notes.txt for information regarding the formating and curation of the original SILVA 111 database.
